# Maze-Generator
A Maze Generator in Java. The following code has the ability to print the Maze Tree in terminal. I am trying to implement [Origing Shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbXKcDVV4G0) but each node only has one parent and child while my nodes should be able to take at most 4 parents and 4 children.
